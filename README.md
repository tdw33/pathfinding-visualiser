# pathfinding-visualiser

## About
This project was a Pygame app that allows the user to visualise the A* pathfinding algorithm. The project is intended to be further developed with additional pathfinding algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm. The user can place two nodes as well as barriers on the grid, and then the algorithm will find the shortest path, but first show how it got to that path with the user of colour on the grid. The user is first greeted with the menu screen, which can be navigated with the arrow keys. To select an option the user must press the enter key.

The A* pathfinding algorithm screen function by first clicking where the start node goes and then the final node. After that, the user can draw out all the barriers they would want. The user can remove squares with the right-click button and reset the whole board the c key can be used. Finally, to see the path the user presses the spacebar.

## Technologies
Python, Pygame

## What I Learned
First, I learned about the A* pathfinding algorithm and its effeteness to find a distance between two known nodes. This algorithm furthers Dijkstra's algorithm where the end node is not known so it, therefore, reaches outwards without a sense of direction. This program can clearly show A8 targeting the end node. As python was used,I learned about classes and functions with the added lesson of integrating a screen component with Pygame.
